##Summary
Take in a JSON file and answer the following "questions":
1. Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list
2. Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
3. Remove the Duplicates
4. Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.
5. Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ instead of a Lambda and vice versa.)
